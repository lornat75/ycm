YCM_USE_CMAKE_2_8_8
-------------------
Use CMake modules imported from CMake 2.8.8.

Some module you would like to use might not available on CMake 2.8.7, or
might have received some bugfix or new feature in CMake 2.8.8. If this
variable is enabled, YCM will allow you to use the new version of these
modules with CMake 2.8.7 or older versions.

This option is available only if :cmake:variable:`CMAKE_VERSION` is
2.8.7 or older.
